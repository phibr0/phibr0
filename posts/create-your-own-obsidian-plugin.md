The Obsidian Developers imagined [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) as an IDE for
Thoughts and Notes, which makes it super extensible by design.

Obsidian is made using Web Technologies, or more specifically TypeScript, HTML,
and CSS. The Desktop Application uses Electron and thus also NodeJS under the
Hood, while the Mobile Apps are using CapacitorJS.

In this Post, we will be recreating one of my first Obsidian Plugins, cycle
through Panes.

## Getting things set up

To create your first Obsidian Plugin, you need to have:

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) installed
- A Code Editor of your choice installed (My personal recommendation would be:
  [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/))

If you want to publish your Plugin someday, you also need the following:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/), a Version Control System
- A [GitHub Account](https://github.com/signup)

You will be using Git to version your Plugin and also to push and pull changes
from the remote Repository, which is basically just a ‚ÄúFolder in the Cloud‚Äù. In
the End, I will tell you more about how to publish the Plugin, so that other
people can install it from inside Obsidian.

The next step would be to clone the
[official Sample Plugin](https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-sample-plugin)
from GitHub.

### With Git and GitHub

If you have a GitHub Account, just click the ‚ÄúUse this Template‚Äù Button and
follow the Instructions:

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*obUhZtw0Lxu8UElDeVNVZw.png)

Once you have your own Repository set up, just copy the following URL:

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*L5VgMlCQlCXyfiKRIlYuIA.png)

Afterwards, you can clone the Repository locally using the following shell
command. Just make sure you are in the correct Directory you want your Plugin to
live in.

```bash
git clone <paste the url here>
```

Now you can finally open the Folder with your Code Editor.

### Without Git and GitHub

If you don‚Äôt plan on publishing your Plugin or don‚Äôt have a GitHub Account, you
can also just download and unpack the Sample Plugin as a ZIP Archive:

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*uTVCB2A_oMXC8G7wM2Qgzg.png)

Now you can open the Folder with your Code Editor, too.

### Compiling and running the Plugin

You will see, there are a lot of files already. But don‚Äôt worry, only three of
them matter at the moment:

- The `main.ts` File, which contains the Code of your Plugin
- The `styles.css` File, which contains a corresponding Style Sheet
- And the `manifest.json` File, which contains important Information, like the
  Version and Name of your Plugin

If you want to, you can already go ahead and look at these Files, you could for
example edit the `manifest.json` to your liking.

Obsidian cannot execute TypeScript files directly, you will need to compile them
to JavaScript first. Luckily, everything, including bundling, is already set up
correctly in the Sample Plugin, so you don‚Äôt have to worry too much about it ü•≥.

Most Code Editors, like Visual Studio Code, already have a Terminal Window built
in. You can use it to run the following two commands after one another:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

The First one will download and cache all dependencies, and the second one will
compile and bundle all your Typescript Files to a single JavaScript File.

Once that‚Äôs done, go ahead and copy the `styles.css`, `manifest.json` and
`main.js` into a newly created Folder inside your Vault under
`<your-vault>/.obsidian/plugins/sample-plugin/`. Now go into Obsidian and enable
your Plugin in the Community Plugins Settings:

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*NQO9j-nTKciyfcRwO6Y22Q.png)

You will notice, that most Text turned red. This is because of the following CSS
inside the `styles.css` you just copied:

```css
/* Sets all the text color to red! */
body {
  color: red;
}
```

This is just a demo to help you get started, you can delete it to revert to the
default colors.

## The sample plugin

Now that everything is set up, let‚Äôs look at the Plugins Code. Note that I
stripped the SampleModal and SampleSettingTab at the End of the File.

```ts
import {
  App,
  Modal,
  Notice,
  Plugin,
  PluginSettingTab,
  Setting,
} from 'obsidian';

interface MyPluginSettings {
  mySetting: string;
}

const DEFAULT_SETTINGS: MyPluginSettings = {
  mySetting: 'default',
};

export default class MyPlugin extends Plugin {
  settings: MyPluginSettings;

  async onload() {
    console.log('loading plugin');

    await this.loadSettings();

    this.addRibbonIcon('dice', 'Sample Plugin', () => {
      new Notice('This is a notice!');
    });
    this.addStatusBarItem().setText('Status Bar Text');
    this.addCommand({
      id: 'open-sample-modal',
      name: 'Open Sample Modal',
      checkCallback: (checking: boolean) => {
        let leaf = this.app.workspace.activeLeaf;
        if (leaf) {
          if (!checking) {
            new SampleModal(this.app).open();
          }
          return true;
        }
        return false;
      },
    });
    this.addSettingTab(new SampleSettingTab(this.app, this));
    this.registerCodeMirror((cm: CodeMirror.Editor) => {
      console.log('codemirror', cm);
    });
    this.registerDomEvent(document, 'click', (evt: MouseEvent) => {
      console.log('click', evt);
    });
    this.registerInterval(
      window.setInterval(() => console.log('setInterval'), 5 * 60 * 1000)
    );
  }

  onunload() {
    console.log('unloading plugin');
  }

  async loadSettings() {
    this.settings = Object.assign({}, DEFAULT_SETTINGS, await this.loadData());
  }

  async saveSettings() {
    await this.saveData(this.settings);
  }
}
```

**Line 1:** Import premade Functions and Components from Obsidian, so you can
use them in your Plugin

**Line 3‚Äì9:** The Settings the Plugin can store and the default Values

**Line 11:** A class extending ‚ÄúPlugin‚Äù is exported. This is always necessary
for a Plugin.

**Line 14:** The `onload()` Function. This is called every time a Plugin is
loaded in Obsidian. It adds a lot of Stuff in the sample Plugin, but that's just
to explain how it works. You can ignore most of them.

**Line 17:** The Settings are loaded into Obsidian. They are stored on the Disk
to persist even when Obsidian is closed. You can see the corresponding Function
at the bottom (Line 51).

**Line 47:** The `onunload()` Function does the same thing as `onload()`, but
when the Plugin is disabled. Note that this isn‚Äôt called when Obsidian closes.

There will also be two more classes. One extends the ‚ÄúModal‚Äù Component and
another one which extends ‚ÄúSettingTab‚Äù. These are used to create a dedicated Tab
in the Settings or to show these nifty pop-up Modals.

## Recreating Cycle through Panes

In our Case, we don‚Äôt need most of this. Our Plugin won‚Äôt even have configurable
Settings. But what does it need to do? If you are reading this you are most
likely using a Browser, to switch between your open Tabs you can press Ctrl +
Tab. Cycle through Panes replicates that behavior with Panes in Obsidian. So,
what we need to do is the following:

- Add a Command to go to the next Pane, triggered by Ctrl + Tab
- Add a Command to go to the previous Pane, triggered by Ctrl + Shift + Tab

Let's use the following as our Starting Point:

```ts
import { MarkdownView, Plugin, WorkspaceLeaf } from 'obsidian';

export default class CycleThroughPanes extends Plugin {
  onload() {
    console.log('loading plugin: Cycle through panes');
  }

  onunload() {
    console.log('unloading plugin: Cycle through panes');
  }
}
```

This is almost the bare minimum you will need for any Plugin. Inside the
`onload()` method, we will be adding the two Commands. The Obsidian API exposes
a method on the Plugin Class to add commands, if you add them using this
official way the User will also be able to change Hotkeys, just like with every
other Command! If you want to read up on it, see the
[official Type Definition](https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-api/blob/5af3ef982328a2dd0a2f5242f3c74e2f45e07896/obsidian.d.ts#L2195).

The `addCommand()` method takes a
[Command Object](https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-api/blob/5af3ef982328a2dd0a2f5242f3c74e2f45e07896/obsidian.d.ts#L410)
as a parameter, which has fields for a name, which is going to be the display
Text, an ID, which is basically the internal name, and a callback, which is a
function that will be executed every time the command is invoked. Instead of
using a regular callback, one can use a checkCallback, editorCallback or
editorCheckCallback. A regular callback can be invoked from everywhere in
Obsidian, while any of the two editorCallback‚Äôs only work while an Editor is
active, the Editor instance will also be available inside the function as a
parameter. The checkCallback‚Äôs are used if you need to implement your own Logic
on when the Callback can be invoked. As an example, the sample implementation
for that only works when there is an active Leaf. Other optional fields are
mobileOnly, icon (mainly for Obsidian Mobile‚Äôs Toolbar) and hotkeys.

Let‚Äôs just create the forward cycle first: Add an ID, name and a checkCallback,
for now you can use an empty arrow function here. If you want to, you can also
set default Values for the Hotkeys already, but it is generally advised to not
do that to avoid conflicts between Plugins. It should look something like this:

```ts
import { MarkdownView, Plugin, WorkspaceLeaf } from 'obsidian';

export default class CycleThroughPanes extends Plugin {
  onload() {
    console.log('loading plugin: Cycle through panes');

    this.addCommand({
      id: 'cycle-through-panes',
      name: 'Cycle through Panes',
      checkCallback: (checking: boolean) => {},
    });
  }

  onunload() {
    console.log('unloading plugin: Cycle through panes');
  }
}
```

Now that we have that, how do we implement the rest?

```ts
import { MarkdownView, Plugin, WorkspaceLeaf } from 'obsidian';

export default class CycleThroughPanes extends Plugin {
  onload() {
    console.log('loading plugin: Cycle through panes');

    this.addCommand({
      id: 'cycle-through-panes',
      name: 'Cycle through Panes',
      checkCallback: (checking: boolean) => {
        let active = this.app.workspace.activeLeaf;
        if (active) {
          if (!checking) {
            let leafs = this.app.workspace.getLeavesOfType('markdown');
            let index = leafs.indexOf(active);
            if (index === leafs.length - 1) {
              this.app.workspace.setActiveLeaf(leafs[0], true, true);
            } else {
              this.app.workspace.setActiveLeaf(leafs[index + 1], true, true);
            }
          }
          return true;
        }
        return false;
      },
    });
  }

  onunload() {
    console.log('unloading plugin: Cycle through panes');
  }
}
```

In **Line 12** we store the currently active leaf inside a variable called
‚Äúactive‚Äù. If there is no active Leaf, this will be null and thus the callback
will return false and not work nor show up in the Command Palette. If the User
invoked the command the passed checking variable will be false and thus our
Logic will run.

In **Line 15** we first get all Markdown Leaves and right after get the Index of
the currently active Leaf.

Now we need to handle an interesting Case. If the active Pane is the last one
and the User switches to the next one, we want to set the first Pane as active.
This is handled by the if statement. If this is not the case, we can simply
increment the index by one.

Now the only thing that's missing is the same Command, but to go in reverse,
from right to left. We can copy almost all the Code, except that we need to
change the ID, name and callback a little bit. In the next Block, you will see
the complete Code:

```ts
import { MarkdownView, Plugin, WorkspaceLeaf } from "obsidian";

export default class CycleThroughPanes extends Plugin {

  setActiveLeaf(leaf: WorkspaceLeaf): void {
    this.app.workspace.setActiveLeaf(leaf);
    (leaf.view as MarkdownView).editor.focus();
  }

  onload() {
    console.log('loading plugin: Cycle through panes');

    this.addCommand({
      id: 'cycle-through-panes',
      name: 'Cycle through Panes',
      checkCallback: (checking: boolean) => {
        let active = this.app.workspace.activeLeaf;
        if (active) {
          if (!checking) {
            let leafs = this.app.workspace.getLeavesOfType("markdown");
            let index = leafs.indexOf(active);
            if (index === leafs.length - 1) {
              this.app.workspace.setActiveLeaf(leafs[0], true, true);
            } else {
              this.app.workspace.setActiveLeaf(leafs[index + 1], true, true);
            }
          }
          return true;
        }
        return false;
      }
    });

    this.addCommand({
      id: 'cycle-through-panes-reverse',
      name: 'Cycle through panes (Reverse)',
      callback: () => {
        let active = this.app.workspace.activeLeaf;
        let leafs = this.app.workspace.getLeavesOfType("markdown");
        let index = leafs.indexOf(active);
        if (index) {
          if (index === 0) {
            this.app.workspace.setActiveLeaf(leafs[leafs.length - 1], true, true);
          } else {
            this.app.workspace.setActiveLeaf(leafs[index - 1], true, true);
          }
        }
      }
    });

  onunload() {
    console.log('unloading plugin: Cycle through panes');
  }
}
```

## Publishing a Plugin

Now everything that‚Äôs left to do is publish the Plugin. This involves 4 Steps,
filling out the manifest.json, pushing the Code to GitHub, creating a Release on
GitHub and finally making a Pull Request to the obsidian-releases Repository
with your Plugin‚Äôs information.

### Filling out the manifest

The Manifest has 8 fields, the _ID_ and _name_, which is almost the same as in a
Command, the _version_, which should follow
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/), the _minAppVersion_, which is the
minimal Obsidian Version that your Plugin depends on, this might change if
Obsidian‚Äôs API changes. A _description_ which is used for the search in the
Plugin Browser, the _author_ and _authorUrl_, which should be you and your
website or GitHub Profile and lastly the _isDesktopOnly_ field, which needs to
be set to true if your Plugin interacts with NodeJS or you are relying on
CodeMirror 5.

### Pushing to GitHub

This step is super easy if you already created a Repository in the first step of
this Post. Just run the following Commands:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Initial Release of a super awesome Plugin"
git remote add origin <url from step 1>
git push origin
```

### Creating a Release on GitHub

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/327/1*135gCoRH8GSeOzHR9JX4qA.png)

On the right-hand side, click on ‚ÄúCreate new release‚Äù. Inside the ‚ÄúChoose a Tag‚Äù
field, add the current version of your Plugin without a v at the front. This
needs to match your manifest.json. If you want, you can add a description and a
Title, but thats optional. What you will need to do, is adding the main.js (run
_npm run build_ to compile it), manifest.json and if you have one styles.css at
the bottom. Once you are ready, hit ‚ÄúPublish Release‚Äù.

### Adding the Plugin to the Community Plugins

Go to the official Obsdian-Releases Repository and
[open the Community Plugins File](https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-releases/blob/master/community-plugins.json).
On the top right, hit Edit and add your Plugin to the end of the List like so:

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/410/1*8VzDSAOeyjCGP_KQsf1Jfw.png)

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/431/1*0BMB4c9k9fJzOfg0bQeqHw.png)

You just need to make sure to not miss any commas and double-check the
Repository Name. After that, you can click on ‚ÄúPropose Changes‚Äù and simply
follow the Instructions given by the Obsidian Developers. You are done ü•≥!
